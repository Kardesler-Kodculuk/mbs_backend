# MBS Backend

This is the Backend Portion of the MBS Project.

## Installation

Clone the git repository using


```
git clone https://github.com/Kardesler-Kodculuk/mbs_backend.git
```

or, alternatively with GitHub CLI

```
gh clone https://github.com/Kardesler-Kodculuk/mbs_backend.git
```

This will clone the repository to a directory called mbs_backend.

Once inside this directory, using npm, you can install the project.

```
npm install
```

Then run

```
npm run start
```

If this runs without errors, and if you see a Hello World text displaying when you go to http://localhost:3000 you are good to go.
